Hi, I’m Yiğit. 
I’m a data scientist working in the energy sector, where I focus on building and deploying machine learning solutions to solve operational problems.  
On this GitHub, you’ll find side projects I’ve built around energy and finance — including time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and ML pipelines.  
Each project reflects my goal of creating practical, production-ready tools with real-world impact.
